You have a few RabbitMQ deployments. How do you monitor them?

You have heard of the [Grafana dashboards that team RabbitMQ maintains](https://grafana.com/orgs/rabbitmq), maybe from this [RabbitMQ Summit 2019 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-tYXpirbpA) or from the official [Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana](https://www.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html) guide. But how do you actually set them up?

And what about the default metrics configuration? Can this be improved?

For speed and convenience, we set up K3S on a Linux host ([we had some Equinix Metal credits](https://info.equinixmetal.com/changelog) that we put to good use) and then:

* We integrate Prometheus & Grafana with K3S, all running inside K3S.
* We set up RabbitMQ Grafana dashboards & deploy the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator, which makes deploying RabbitMQ on K8S as easy as it gets.
* We deploy a few RabbitMQ workloads and look at their behaviour via Grafana, paying special attention to memory pressure coming from the metrics system.

If your RabbitMQ nodes run many queues, channels & connections and you are using the default metrics configuration, this will help you understand how to optimise that.
