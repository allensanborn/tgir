* GL: Introduce the TGIR

* GS: Start with sildes, what are the problems we need to solve?
	  Expose RabbitMQ using kubernetes.
	  We have different ways to do that.
	  Let's start with the simplest way, k8s Operator using load-balancer option.
	  We reached the aim, but... 	
* GS: We are not happy, too many IP adress, clients are connected directly to 
      the server. If you need to create another cluster and move the connections you need to change the IP, or if you want to implement a canary update it is not possible or hard to do. It is not a best prectise in k8s.
* GS: Back to the slides and show the next steps.      
* GS: We need an ingress, what is an Ingress?  (Link)
	  Speak about traefik.
	  We need it in TLS mode ( traefik).
	  Ok so we need a certificate

* GL: Create the certificate using let's encrypt

* GS: Deploy traefik, show the end points configuration in values.
	  How to configure the end points.
* GS: Deploy bugs and bunny, in this case we don't use use the load-balancer
      option. Show the TLS configuration and the option disableNonTLSListeners.

* GS: Deploy bugs and bunny ingress, explain the SNI Match.
	  Relation between ingress and endpoints.
	  
	  
* GS: Perf-test with for bugs, bunny and a wrong sni.
