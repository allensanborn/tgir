This is the second part on how to contribute to RabbitMQ.

See how you can contribute a new Erlang/OTP 22 feature to RabbitMQ 3.8 in these three simple steps:

1. Add a few lines of code to [rabbitmq-prometheus](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-prometheus) plugin
2. Update the [Erlang-Distribution](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11352) Grafana dashboard
3. Open a pull request üôåüèª

The goal of this episode is for **you** to contribute this change üòâ
